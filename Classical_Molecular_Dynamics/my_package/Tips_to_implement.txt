- Type annotations: in function definition (arguments and return values) and unclear variable definitions 
  (like "my_list = []" instead of "my_list: list[int] = []")
  
- Forgiveness over permission: use the "try" and "except" blocks. Read here for more: 
  https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html
  https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python/python-try-except/

Example:
  "try:
      ...
   except FileNotFoundError:
      print("Specified file not found")"
  
  instead of
  
  "if os.path.exists("your_path"):
      ...
   else:
      print("Specified file not found")"
      
- when you pass the same arguments in several functions, it's time for classes. Use the dataclass from the module "dataclasses"

- global constants (centralized structure) and use paths, specifically import Path class from the module pathlib

- use docstrings. Read here for more: https://peps.python.org/pep-0257/
