#--------------------# OUTPUT FORMAT in 'main.py' #--------------------#

The folder storing the entirety of the simulation is called using a time convention. Example: '01_Jan31_10_35'

'01': the month ordinal number (given in 01-12 format, used for file ordering)
'Jan': the abbreviated name of the month
'31': day of the month
'10': hour of the day (given in 00-23 format)
'35': minute of the hour (given in 00-59 format)

- REGULAR OUTPUT: escape time

The file is called 'Output.txt' and is divided in 5 columns:

0-th: 'sim_time', the length of the simulation until now. Given in seconds
1-th: the nominal coverage corresponding to 'sim_time', thus it is NOT the actual coverage. Given in MonoLayers (or atoms)
2-th: 'tau', the extracted escaping time of the selected (thus performed) event. Given in seconds
3-th: 'theta', the actual coverage. Given in MonoLayers (or atoms)
4-th: 'rough', the actual surface roughness. Given in MonoLayers (or atoms)

DIFFUSION ONLY:
5-th: 'K_DEPO', the deposition transition rate
6-th: 'summed_K_DIFF', the total diffusion transition rate (sum along K_DIFF)

- EVERY NOW and THEN OUTPUT: snap

The files are called 'SNAP0001.xyz'. They are compatipable with Ovito and they list:

0-th row: total number of the atoms = atoms ON the surface + atoms OF the surface
1-th row: 'theta', the actual coverage. Given in MonoLayers (or atoms)
2-th and following rows: the position of each atom, given as 'x, y, z', in unit of atomic positions, which is zero-based 
     (thus '0, 34, 1' means 1st atom on the x axis, 35th on the y and 2nd on the z)

- FINAL OUTPUT: input_parameters

The file is called "Input_parameters.txt" and shows different useful infos:

0-th row: DIFFUSION_BOOL - 'False' = Deposition only and save files in "1st_part", otherwise for 'True'
1-th row: PHI - Deposition flux expressed in ML/s
2-th row: TEMP - Temperature at which diffusion happens
3-th row: SEED - seed used for the number random generator

4-th row: snap_dt - the simulation time passing between two successive snaps (useful for Ovito's visualizations)

NOTE: the first 4 rows are those actually used in "Input_parameters.txt" (in "KMC/Ag epitaxy") when launching simulations

#--------------------# TO DO #--------------------#

1st_part:

- watch how 'tau' values are extracted (so simply verify that they pop out "randomically"?)
- check (test? statistically test?) that <tau> = 1/k_depo
- plot the distribution of 'tau' for each sim, maybe even do a plot of all the sims with different seeds and maybe perform a 
  statistichal check wrt the exponential distribution
- make animations and snaps of the surface morphology: tower like structures? Multi-layer growth??
- observe that 'rough' goes as sqrt(actual theta), try to explain it (see slide 8 of 'CMS10'). Maybe do a plot of 
  'nominal' vs 'actual' coverage, to check that the relation is ~ linear as predicted and do it for several seeds 
  (both 'rough' and 'theta')

Animations:
given that a snap was saved every 100 ms and that the animation plays at 10 frames per sec, the shown deposition
speed is indeed the same of the simulation!

2nd_part:

- make animations and snaps of the surface morphology (change 'dt_snap' accordingly)
- observe and compare all together 'rough' vs 'theta' (actual coverage)
- when LbL, make animations and snaps of the initial stages (theta < 0.1 ML and lower the 'dt_snap' value)
- when LbL, what is the effect of deacreasing PHI? Make appropriate graphs and explain them
- T value for PHI = 1 ML/s in order to see the same behaviour as when PHI = 0.01 ML/s and T = 650K

I will assume that a LbL growth is obtained when PHI = 0.1 - 0.01 - 0.0001 [ML/s]

"tau_t_cov" has points that are stacked on top of each other, due to the fact that when diffusion is happening
the coverage is not changed? Reasonable, as these "stacks" disappear when "tau_t_tim" is plotted.

----- An effect well seen for PHI = 0.1 - 0.01:
"tau_t_tim" and "tau_t_cov" show apparently periodic structure, linked to the layer deposition?
Yes, just look at the plots called "tau_oscillations":
when k_diff is big there is a high chance of a diffusion event extraction (and thus of a small escape time, because the total
matrix weight is huge, but a single k_diff is smaller than k_depo), on the contrary, when k_diff is small, there's a higher
chance of a deposition event extraction, which has a bigger escape time. This behaviour is also clearly seen in the evolution
of the roughness: high roughness means lots of islands, thus more bonded adatoms and therefore less diffusion happening

"tau_d" has a different shape than the exponential one, because K_TOT changes at every simulation step, and thus the
exponential distribution from which the events are exctracted is not fixed. Intuitively, K_TOT is bigger on average (due to
diffusion) and thus more extractions of small tau values are expected.

"tau_d" shows that for higher values of PHI, the distribution of tau values is squeezed towards lower values of tau. This is
reasonable as a higher PHI means lower K_DEPO and thus the extracted times are closer to that of a single diffusione event.
Indeed, this behaviour is observed in the "tau_oscillation" plot of K_DEPO and K_DIFF.





The first 6 simulations are those with a 'dt_snap' value predicted by 100 ms * (0.2 / PHI), the followings are those for which
I searched the proper T in order to observe the same behaviour of PHI = 0.01 and T = 650 K at PHI = 1.

Seed #1 (from 'Feb06_16_05')
- predicted 800 K
- checking value of 850 K   - discarded
- checking value of 750 K   - discarded
- predicted 764 K

Seed #2 (from 'Feb08_11_23')
- reference at T = 650 K
- predicted 800 K
- predicted 764 K

Seed #3 (from 'Feb08_11_31')
- reference at T = 650 K
- predicted 800 K
- predicted 764 K





The first 6 simulations are those with a 'dt_snap' value predicted by 100 ms * (0.2 / PHI), then we searched the proper T.
The following sims are made with a different'dt_snap' value and stops at THETA = 2 ML circa, in order to observe differences 
between the LbL modes:

dt_snap = 0.1 * (100 * 1e-3) * (0.2/PHI)   ---> 10 times more frames than before

The simulations are:
02_Feb08_12_49_phi_0.0001
02_Feb08_12_57_phi_0.001
02_Feb08_12_59_phi_0.01
02_Feb08_13_00_phi_0.1

The associated animations and pictures are stored in the "Presentation_material/LbL growth" directory.

- 0.0001 One or three static islands that do not change shape and get bigger and round in shape (memo: PBCs are at play!)
- 0.001 Static islands that do not change shape, they are a few and just get increasingly bigger
- 0.01 Large number of small static islands that change shape and are not round anymore (because freshly deposited adatoms arrive 
and are not able to find a proper site along the island to stick in, ie they do not 'thermalize' with the island). The islands
then fuse together starting from a web alike structure.
- 0.1 Smallest islands can disappear, while 'bigger' ones are static. They fuse together starting from a network that is slowly
filled exibiting a multi-layer behaviour
