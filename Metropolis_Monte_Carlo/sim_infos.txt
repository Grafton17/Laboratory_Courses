The name of the output folder is something like "20_0_60_1", meaning:

- 20 adatoms are used
- temperature of 0 K
- the lattice size is equal to 60 atoms
- the used seed is the number 1

- REGULAR OUTPUT: escape time

The file is called 'Output.txt' and is divided in 3 columns:

0-th: 'i', i-th step of the MC loop (starts from 1, bc the initialized configuration is stored as 0-th step)
1-th: 'old_Energy', the energy of the i-th configuration, whether it was accepted or rejected
2-th: 'is_accepted', 1 == the trial move was accepted, 0 == the trial move was rejected

- EVERY NOW and THEN OUTPUT: snap

The files are called 'SNAP0001.xyz'. They are compatipable with Ovito and they list:

0-th row: total number of the atoms = atoms ON the surface + atoms OF the surface
1-th row: 'i', i-th step of the MC loop (starts from 1, bc the initialized configuration is stored as 0-th step)
2-th and following rows: the position of each atom, given as 'x, y, z', in unit of atomic positions, which is zero-based 
     (thus '0, 34, 1' means 1st atom on the x axis, 35th on the y and 2nd on the z)

- FINAL OUTPUT: input_parameters

The file is called "YOURinput_parameters.txt" and shows different useful infos:

0-th row: TEMP_BOOL - 'False' = No Metropolis rejection rule and save files in "1st_part", otherwise for 'True'
1-th row: TEMP - temperature at which the system sits
2-th row: N_ADATOMS - the number of adatoms on the surface
3-th row: SEED - seed used for the number random generator

NOTE: these rows are those actually used in "Input_parameters.txt" (in "MMC/Ag_surface_equilibrium") when launching simulations
      Except for the 'output_name'

#--------------------# TO DO #--------------------#

1st_part:

These sims were done with 5e6 steps, then I switched back to 1e6 because it was pointless:
"2_0_60_1"
"3_0_60_1"
"4_0_60_1"
"5_0_60_1"
"6_0_60_1"

Seed1:
N = 18 is metastable, it forms one 3x2 and one 3x4 clusters
N = 16 is metastable for the majority of the MC loops, it clusterize in a 4x4 only in the end

Seed2:
N = 18 is not metastable anymore, it forms a 6x3 cluster
N = 16 clusterize faster and it is discarded during the average computation

2nd_part:

The sims are done with 3e6 steps

I o not save snaps for memory and speed reasons. And print the sim status every 50e4 and not every 5e3 steps.
